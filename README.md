This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply correctly despite successful compilation and no visible errors in the code. The issue is likely tied to the complexity of class combinations or the presence of conflicting directives within the CSS. The `bug.html` file showcases the problem, and `bugSolution.html` provides a possible solution.  Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve or expand this example.
