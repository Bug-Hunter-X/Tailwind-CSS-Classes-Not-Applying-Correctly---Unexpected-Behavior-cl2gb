The solution involved carefully reviewing the complex class combinations used in the HTML.  A subtle conflict between classes was identified.  Refactoring those classes and utilizing more precise and less ambiguous selector combinations resolved the issue.  The use of the `@apply` directive was replaced with more straightforward class combinations and ensuring the correct order of classes was maintained.  Additional logging and debugging tools in the browser's developer console were also helpful in pinpointing the root cause.
